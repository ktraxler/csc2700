My project is a Raspberry pi based motion activated security camera with a website.

upon activation it will upload "video" of a series of still pictures to a website. (every second? every two?)

I will look into full video streaming but due to the pi's limited proccessing power im worried it 
wont be able to stream hd videos.

if time allows I would like to add the ability to turn on the camera via the web client.

note, camera interface is already coded for the pi.
 half way point would be to get the camera detecting motion and taking pictures. 
 
CORE:
1. Install motion on pi
2. Mount shared windows folder
3. Modify motion.conf so that it is always running, 2 fps, saves in shared folder
HALF:
4. Make stream open to everyone
5. Intergrate into a website
6. tune and make everything pretty
EXTRA:
7. Would be nice to get a email or text when it is set off 
8. see how fast a fps the pi can handle
9. auto delete once a week to keep the folder clear
10.option to turn off via shh or something 
11. always streaming at 1 pic per minute even when no motion.
