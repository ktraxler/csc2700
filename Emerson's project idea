My project is a Raspberry pi based motion activated security camera with a website.

upon activation it will upload "video" of a series of still pictures to a website. (every second? every two?)

I will look into full video streaming but due to the pi's limited proccessing power im worried it 
wont be able to stream hd videos.

if time allows I would like to add the ability to turn on the camera via the web client.

note, camera interface is already coded for the pi.
 half way point would be to get the camera detecting motion and taking pictures.
