For my project I'm going to create a sales/inventory system for a music(instrument) store.

Given time constraints I hope to have a program that, at the bare minimum, can keep track
of inventory for all instruments and accessories sold and that can make basic sales 
transactions with the inventory given.

I also want to divide the instruments into brand in model just for realisms sake. Not
too many models or brands mind you.

If I have time I would also like to add:
 - A trade-in, buyback, and refund feature to the sales system.
 - Say it was a mom & pop music store and was fairly small. A 
   lot of these places offer lessons for certain instruments
   so I planned on adding a feature to where there'd be a few
   basic lessons I'll make myself on a word processor for Linux
   for each instrument and allow the user to pick from these files
   in the data structure I'll put them in.
 - I also would like the ability to let the user give a set amount
   of money he could spend as well. Might charge for the music 
   lessons too.
   
I basically want it to be as close to a real store as possible. 

Let me know what you guys think!
