Updated: Sound output was not going well for me in Java. Luckily was working on back-up project. A simplified 
rendition of the ASCII game "Rogue" recreated in Java. 


Specifications:

General constraints:

The program will be written entirely in Java. No external graphics will be used to represent any elememts of the game, 
but instead strictly ASCII characters. 

Goals and guidelines:

The program will be a simplified version of the game "Rogue." ASCII characters will be used as graphics to represent the character, rooms and enemies. 
A dungeon will be created with each floor having randomly generated rooms. The player will traverse the rooms through corridors
and try to find stairs to go to the next room.

Development methods:

Objects will hold different entities, such as the player, enemies, items, and rooms. Rooms will randomly be generated 
rectangles using procedural algorithm.

Policies and Tactics:

The entire game will be written in Java and compiled in Eclipse. A profiler used specifically in Java will be used for
profiling the game. The program will be tested in both Windows and Linux.
