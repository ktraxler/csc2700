My goal is to implement OSC (open sound control) in a project.

The project I have in mind will read an online world birth/death clock.
Convert that number into some kind of musical note.
Use OSC to send that note in an OSC message to some program/device to play the note.

Mid-point goal: Obtain world clock data into program and convert to musical note.
Wrap in OSC message.

Final goal: From there it's a matter of setting up a receiver to parse and play the note(s).



Development Strategy: I intend to use java to look up birth/death information from 
"http://www.census.gov/popclock/", parse that data into musical values, Pd-extended 
to play the music notes at those values, and OSC to communicate between the two.

Data will flow in this direction:
"http://www.census.gov/popclock/" --> java application -OSC-> Pd-extended

Java classes:
Main.java
ClockDataRetriever.java
MusicDataParser.java

Java libraries
JavaOSC

Pd file construction:
OSC receiver
frequency oscililators
digital to audio convertor
